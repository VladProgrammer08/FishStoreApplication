# 🐠 Aqua World - Aquarium Fish Store 🐠

## Introduction

Welcome to the Aqua World - Aquarium Fish Store README. The store is a fictional web platform created to help users shop and admire
the many species found in the marine world that are sometimes difficult to observe in their natural habitat, as well as to shop different kinds of aquarium tanks and different decoration to make the aquarium look better. This allows the user
to view the available types of fish, aquariums, and decorations, read the details and add the item they like to the wishlist, or item they want to buy to the cart, and for administrators, provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
functionality to manage product listings, applications, updates, and user accounts.
