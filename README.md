# 🐠 Aqua World - Aquarium Fish Store 🐠

## Introduction

Welcome to the Aqua World - Aquarium Fish Store README. The store is a fictional web platform created to help users shop and admire
the many species found in the marine world that are sometimes difficult to observe in their natural habitat. This allows the user
to view the available types of fish, read the details and add the fish they like to the cart, and for administrators, provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
functionality to manage fish listings, applications, updates, and user accounts.
